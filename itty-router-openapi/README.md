This redirect exists here, because the old itty-router-openapi documentation was hosted on github pages, at
https://cloudflare.github.io/itty-router-openapi/
But now that itty-router-openapi has been renamed into chanfana, the old url started returning 404,
so this folder was created to redirect old links.
